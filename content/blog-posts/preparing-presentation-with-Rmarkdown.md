I've always found preparing presentations using tools like powerpoint frustrating.

You have to insert all those text boxes, adjust them, pick the right font size, and then you have to pick the font size for another text box because powerpoint has reset it to default... There are lots of settings and options that you struggle to get the idea of, and all that automatically inserted bullet points!

Finally, you need to copy-paste all the graphs you've built with matplotlib and adjust the size... 

Sometimes that takes longer than the actual analysis you did.
And it definitely takes much more mental health!

Good news is that you can solve all that issues all at once with **R Markdown** -
a tool specifically developed for reproducible data storytelling.
With it you can run Python or R code in separate cells exposing the output,
embed graphs, and accompany all that with nicely formatted comments,
all that without ever leaving the text editor of your preference!

You can place a [link to it](/presentation.html) or even embed it right into your page!
